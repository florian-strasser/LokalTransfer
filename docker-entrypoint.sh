# Start LokalTransfer, with or without a database of its own.
#
# The image carries a full MySQL server so that `docker run` on a fresh machine
# gives a working instance with nothing else to set up. But a real deployment
# usually already has a database — a managed one, or a separate container — and
# in that case running a second, unused MySQL inside this container would waste
# memory and, worse, create a second place data could accidentally land.
#
# So the rule is: an external database if one is configured, the built-in one
# otherwise. `NUXT_MYSQL_HOST` is what decides, because that is the variable a
# person setting up an external database sets first.

# --- Configuration from a mounted file ------------------------------------

# Nitro reads real environment variables at runtime and, unlike `nuxt dev`, does
# not load a .env file. Deployments that supply configuration as a mounted file
# are common enough to support here. Real environment variables win, so
# `--env-file`, compose `environment:` and host panels all override the file.
